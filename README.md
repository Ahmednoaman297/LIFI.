# Li-Fi Hazard Detection System

## Project Overview

Li-Fi Hazard Detection System is a prototype designed to detect hazards using Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) technology. This system integrates sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules to detect and notify users of potential dangers such as fire, intrusions, or open doors.

## Project Description

The Li-Fi Hazard Detection System comprises a sender platform connected to three types of sensors: Fume Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Magnetic Sensor. When any of these sensors detect a hazard, data is transmitted using Li-Fi technology to a receiver platform. The receiver platform then triggers alarms including a flashing lamp, buzzer, and LCD display. Additionally, notifications are sent to a mobile phone via Bluetooth, providing real-time hazard alerts to users.

### Key Features:

- **Sender Platform**: TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller.
- **Sensors**:
  - Fume Sensor
  - Ultrasonic Sensor
  - Magnetic Sensor
- **Receiver Platform**: Any compatible microcontroller for receiving Li-Fi signals.
- **Alarms**: Flashing Lamp, Buzzer, LCD Display.
- **Mobile App**: Alerts sent via Bluetooth to a mobile app for remote notifications.
- **User Interface**: Two pushbuttons for start/stop operations and a mute button to silence alarms.
